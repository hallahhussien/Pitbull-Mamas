## Problem Statement

**Pitbull Mamas** will be the holy grail for all pit bull owners. Due to the lack of information on what it's really like to own a pitbull due to the stigma against them.
Pit bulls are very intelligent and powerful dogs, they need a special diet and toys that can keep them out of trouble.
I started this research due to the simple fact that I could not find a toy that my lil fur baby did not destroy instantly.
I want to be able to put pitbulls in a different light for the public by allowing people to upload pictures of their babies, share stories, and review products so we can
all help our beloved four legged friends live the best life possible.
